# Intro To API's

* Application Programming Interface
* They are interfaces for code/computers to talk to one another
* Web API's -this is a subset of API. Generally communicate via HTTP. Example: Twitter API - give me all the tweets that mention "ice cream". Weather API - what is the weather in Missoula Montana?
* When we get notifications on our phone about giving a certian application permission to access certain data from our phone, this is usually sent from an API
* IFTTT.com - if this then that. It is website that can be used to combine APIs. They work with different APIs of several companies
* ProgrammableWeb.com - API directory

# Data Formats

* When we use the internet, we make HTTP request and get HTML back
* API's don't respond with HTML. HTML contains information about the structure of a page. 
* API's respond with data, not structure
* They use simpler data formats like XML and JSON

# XML (Extended Markup Language)

* XML is syntacticly similar to HTML, but it does not describe presentation like HTML does
* it does not follow a format like HTML

# JSON (Javascript Object Notation)

* JSON looks exactly like javascript onjects, but everything is a string
* it is more popular because our code is already in JS and no need to convert it, unlike XML
